Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about the BSON data format, how MongoDB
uses it, and how to install the BSON library independently of the
{+driver-short+}.

BSON Data Format
----------------

**BSON**, or Binary JSON, is the data format that MongoDB uses to organize
and store data. This data format includes all JSON data structure types and
adds support for types including dates, differently-sized integers, ObjectIds, and
binary data. For a complete list of supported types, see the
:manual:`BSON Types </reference/bson-types>` server manual page.

The binary format is not human-readable, but you can use the
:ref:`BSON library <install-bson-library>` to convert it to the human-readable JSON
representation. You can read more about the relationship between these
formats in the :website:`JSON and BSON </json-and-bson>` guide on the MongoDB website.

MongoDB and BSON
----------------

You can use BSON data with your {+driver-short+} application by using one of the
following object types that implements the `BSON interface <{+api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/conversions/Bson.html>`__:

- `Document <{+api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/Document.html>`__ (BSON library package)
- `BsonDocument <{+api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/BsonDocument.html>`__ (BSON library package)
- `RawBsonDocument <{+api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/RawBsonDocument.html>`__ (BSON library package)
- `JsonObject <{+api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/json/JsonObject.html>`__ (BSON library package)

Install the BSON Library
------------------------

These instructions detail how to add the BSON library as a dependency to
your project. If you added the MongoDB Kotlin driver as a dependency to your
project, you can skip this step since the BSON library is already included
as a required dependency of the driver.

.. TODO: For instructions on how to add the
.. MongoDB Kotlin driver as a dependency to your project, see the
.. :ref:`driver installation <kotlin-sync-download-install>` section of our Get Started
.. guide.

We recommend that you use the `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__ or
`Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__ build automation tool to manage your project's
dependencies. Select from the following tabs to see the dependency declaration
for that tool:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Maven
      :tabid: maven-dependencies

      The following snippet shows the dependency declaration in the
      ``dependencies`` section of your ``pom.xml`` file.

      .. include:: /includes/data-formats/bson-maven-versioned.rst

   .. tab:: Gradle
      :tabid: gradle-dependencies

      The following snippet shows the dependency declaration in the
      ``dependencies`` object in your ``build.gradle`` file.

      .. include:: /includes/data-formats/bson-gradle-versioned.rst

If you are not using one of the preceding tools, you can include it in
your project by downloading the JAR file directly from the
`sonatype repository <https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/mongodb/bson/>`__.
