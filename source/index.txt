Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the {+driver-long+}, the official
MongoDB driver for synchronous Kotlin applications. Download the driver by using
`Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__ or `Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__, or set up a
runnable project by following our Quick Start guide.

.. tip:: Other Kotlin Platforms for MongoDB

   If your Kotlin application requires asynchronous processing, use the
   :driver:`Coroutine Driver </kotlin/coroutine/currenet>`, which uses coroutines for
   server-side applications.
   
   If you are developing an Android or Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)
   application, you can use the :realm:`MongoDB Atlas Device Kotlin SDK </sdk/kotlin/>` 
   to access Atlas App Services and to manage your Realm data.
